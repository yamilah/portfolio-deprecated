       <h1>PROPOSAL</h1>
        <p>
            For my ScrollFlight site, I'm looking to curate a collection of prose I have written. It's a set of about ten poems. Currently, I have them laid out on my website with styled text, but it might be more interesting to curate them in a way that better reflects the narratives within them.
        </p>
        <p>
            My goal is to critically examine the poems and select imagery that will best set the scene for them, and help to better deliver the content to the reader. I might have a large image prefacing each poem to act as a "palate cleanser," from one poem to the next. I might also have effects implemented between them that reflects each poem's tone (e.g., a poem with a sad tone might slowly fade in; a poignant and pithy poem might have a transition associated with it that is sharp and quick, etc.). I want to also be attentive to the color schemes I use, and this is something that can also change on scroll.
        </p>
        <p>
            Over all, I'm looking for an interesting way to make it such that the reader will want to continue reading--not just for the content, but also to fully become immersed in the readings as multimedia experiences.
