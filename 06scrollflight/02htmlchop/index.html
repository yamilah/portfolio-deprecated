                <h1>BRAIDS</h1>
                <p>
                    I feel the braids in the wooden floors beneath my feet, and I think of mama's hair. Her black curls unfurl before me and I lose myself in the memories of home—in the floors mama has always wanted. "Bueno, Diós proveerá; ojala, en otra vida..."
                </p>
                <p>
                    She spoke about them while cleaning, as the bleach she poured ran from its bottle and escaped into the grey, concrete fissures, overlapping in all their unevenness. Then it would soak our socks; dad would boom defiantly through the home, dragging his feet on the cold, rough stone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But mama would just lay in bed, satisfied with her cleaning,—chest bare—as I'd tug and wrestle with her hair. As I braided and untangled, I listened to her stories: messy, like the sound of three languages finding themselves en una sola lengua. She'd tell me about el baba, the fidayeen, about el barrio, los campos, la pobreza. She'd tell me about the home we have owned in the Holy Land since the time of Jesus Christ. I'd laugh a bit. She would not.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From here, I can only ever hear the muffled cries of the homeland over the telephone,—from every relative I don't know as well as I should—but I carry them with me everywhere. The calling cards sprawled on the table, heavy sighs from la familia. They try to tell me about the guns; I don't understand. To me, they sound like the plátanos popping in the pan.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Tienen vergüenza que no pudieron estar ahí cuando naciste," says mama. Later, she tells me, "el tio Atef se está muriendo, 7abibti."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tonight, on a night like this, I think of these moments: the booming feet, life long sighs; the loss of home, family; the bombs, the concrete. I think of the stories I'll tell her cuando regreso. I'll show her pictures of my room, but avoid all the messy parts. I'll tell her about the two gringas at work today who screamed at me to "go back" to the countries I've only seen in pictures and imagined in memories. I'll tell her that I asked them, "which one?" I'll laugh. She won't.

                <h1>DAILY RICE</h1>
                <p>
                    You say my name and, in the same breath,<br>
                    whisper names of lands that I've never been to.<br>
                    You taught me to cup my tongue on the first syllable, ready to eat the daily rice:<br>
                    "Poquito porque es bendito," you'd say—right after, "ya comí, ustedes comen."
                </p>
                <p>
                    You didn't give me your hair, your skin, or even the color of your eyes,<br>
                    but I can see our homes in them—<br>
                    the ones they live in now. Without us.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You know, I saw him cry for the first time in that same darkness.<br>
                    I stared into it as I heard the sobs.<br>
                    I wasn't looking for him, but for people who have died and forgotten us,<br>
                    who hide behind mirrors blocked off with black cloth—<br>
                    heavy: like border, like black sky, like wrinkle, like every held breath and desperate whisper.

                <h1>DREAMING OF HAIR</h1>
                <p>
                    I was raised quietly.<br>
                    I knew all too well how a glance, a word, a gesture<br>
                    could turn my body into a battleground. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Somewhere in my cumulative years,<br>
                    I learned that silence stopped the friction of fist on skin.<br>
                    You ask me why I don't speak,<br>
                    but you know mama will die fearing you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To stand up to a man,<br>
                    I reduce myself to a child again, playing the adult.<br>
                    A man dragging a woman by the hair.<br>
                    I found little black clumps around for days after.<br>
                    A plant being torn up by the roots by harsh winds,<br>
                    conjuring sand and soil to cut my ankles to distract from the fact that they are shaking.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I tell myself that I have grown harder,<br>
                    that my heart has callused,<br>
                    that I don't see you in my dreams and wake up screaming.<br>
                    I touch the scars, the holes in the walls.<br>
                    I remember my rusted flavor.<br>
                    I tell myself that, in retrospect, it tasted good.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Yesterday, I cut my hair so that you would never again be able to drag me by it.

                <h1>HALAWEH</h1>
                <p>
                    The sun finds la cocina again this morning, and I watch you make the halaweh early today. It reminds me of the times I've spent watching you make arepas, folding water into harina. You reach into el pote, pull out a glob—it hangs onto the spoon, begs for the pot again. “Está caliente,” you say. I look into the spoon, see my reflection in that sweet, hot, melting honey y siento una pena que conozco bien. The reflection is never me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Up until that day, I only watched you and Kelly in the bathroom: almost naked, in total silence, pulling hairs. But eventually, you would lay the halaweh on my legs, too—the same ones that hid the secret between them. I could not ignore the burning; that same day, you washed my bloodied underwear by hand. It was the truth I didn't want you to see, the truth I will never be comfortable with: my own womanhood—a hot, melting, ripping sensation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That same evening, I shamefully buried my face in your lap. I know you felt my tears, but you didn't know what to say.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Years later, con mucha vergüenza, I confessed to you that I only liked halaweh in my mouth. You were not surprised, you said, "ya sé."

                <h1>POURING</h1>
                <p>
                    How slow the morning comes to this city, held hostage among hours not yet ready to end. The sun speaks the language of day that finds your cheek—softly. It reminds me of the times my lips have met your body,—the rice I eat each furtive evening before bed—your sunken belly—the bowl I drink from each morning, before I know I must leave you for the day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I’m not afraid of your arms,—the ones that wrap around me every evening—the space between your eyes, your legs, or even your love. I think it’s because I know that if I pour my body into yours, we will fit perfectly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I think it’s because I need someone who isn’t afraid that I fit in their mouth, that I languished—hungry—for years and now I am small for it. I need someone who knows not to hug me too hard, to take me in their palms and squeeze. I need someone who knows how to be gentle, who could love enough to hear my faint voice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I think it's because your knees catch mine and they keep me from drifting, from mistaking your loving touch for one that bruised me. You trace soft poems into my skin with your fingers; you have never left a mark. Every kiss is a choice I make, every touch an answer to a question.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Gradually, you unravel to the sound of hums from a patient love that no longer waits; and I try to count the yielding hours as we cross one year over the next.

                <h1>WAITING, WITHERING</h1>
                <p>
                    You called me not too long ago, didn't you? You cried, wondering how 30 years could go by like this. You're poor, hungry, and you squat the home your children grew up in; now, we're in college. Under leaky roofs, rainy skies, between grey, chipping walls, you carve away at your skin to count every year you spend waiting for her to grow up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is an immediacy about our lives—who eats first, what gets paid first—and still, it drags on forever.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So what could I possibly learn in a classroom that I haven't already learned by your fists? How can my stomach be as empty as yours was in the homeland? What if I told you I left to be away from your fists and now miss the food my purpled mama makes?
                </p>
                <p>
                    You will both die waiting and all I can do is watch you wither away. The water that falls from the ceiling will not bring you back.

                <h1>WOUNDED COASTS, DERELICT SHIPS</h1>
                <p>
                    I lost myself in that last generation.<br>
                    I hold myself tightly, trying to remember.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I can only remember the cold terrazzo floors under my knees—<br>
                    I melted into them for you.<br>
                    Yes, I did:<br>
                    I gave in, I begged you to stop.<br>
                    But how could I have known?<br>
                    How could I have known my supplications would not impress you?<br>
                    You were a god before me:<br>
                    wild and unknowable in all your thrashings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The things you burned in anger, desperation—<br>
                    they are charred now; my tongue, our languages, pages of history, photos:<br>
                    all fed to the fire that promised to keep us warm.<br>
                    It didn't.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But it's only when I mouth around this language—<br>
                    this language of burning—<br>
                    that I taste my own ashes.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I found our losses purpled on my face;<br>
                    a wounded coast to your derelict ships.

                <h1>SIGHING</h1>
                <p>
                    Shame: it's incoherent. I skip over the difficult parts, not admitting them to myself. The desperation, the longing, loving; I was an ocean breaking itself on jagged rocks—ceaselessly. "I can't explain it," a sigh. "You just changed so much." Limestone, rough beneath my feet. I can see she's not interested in listening, so I let a soft light catch her eye and keep it a secret.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tempered glass lines the balcony;—green, the color of highrise condos, stark white against the setting sun—in any direction there are malls, country clubs, animal fur couches, cascading rainbows from chandeliers. I felt strange, so I let myself wander: a stopped car in the middle of Biscayne. A panicked mama, now too old to push hunks of metal around town, crying into a worn steering wheel. I'm afraid of what dad will do when he finds out, but I know mama will take the beating for me. A text. so are you coming over or
                </p>
                <p>
                    I wanted to explain, to imagine her worried at her desk,—omw—getting in her car, appearing fifteen minutes later at my side with a car jack and a ride. Nothing but a trailing voice, beeping cars behind us, a sniffle. "I'm sorry, Yamilah, tenemos que regresar..."
                </p>
                <p>
                    I had her over once, maybe twice. It was a cold evening in our tropical city. Taking this for an opportunity at a cold Christmas, I asked mama for money so I could buy ingredients to make cookies with my guest. I didn't want to admit it, but I was ashamed of our home—the unfinished, unleveled concrete floors. The mismatched furniture dad rescued from some roadside dumpster or another. The spiders watching with suspicion in every corner; the small, tipping oven a friend had given us. But we were busy together, baking and laughing with every broken knob, rusted mirror, lurking roach, every crack in every wall.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The second time, she pulled up in front of the home and didn't come in. I got into the car and pretended not to notice her texting an unfamiliar name, while she pretended not to notice my slight frame. We stopped to get gas while pretending not to hear my rumbling belly. "I'm so hungry!" A weak laugh gave way to more silence. And then I caved. "I wish I wasn't so poor." I was too honest. "I feel you," she breathes in. "I was going to put gas in and my card got rejected." A long pause, I tried to calculate what the best response would be, my body shaking with hunger. An exhale, "Had to transfer money from my savings."
                </p>
                <p>
                    The sun is setting now, and I watch her nervously run her fingers through her hair in the direction of the door; I ask myself if she is trying to find something in her swishing glass of wine, staring so intently. "I feel so alone in my college," the soft light of a canopied balcony fades, a well groomed dog scuttles by, limestone, warm sun. She continues, saying, "everyone has so much money." I exhale and wonder if she is ashamed of anything.
