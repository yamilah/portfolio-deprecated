       <h1>PROPOSAL</h1>
        <p>
            I've had a design for a portfolio site that I've been meaning to implement for a while--it'll contain my selected works and a filtration method.
        </p>
        <p>
            My goal is to curate all my artwork, and be decisive about how to properly display my multimedia practices. Sometimes I'll be working with physical pieces (e.g., paintings), other times I'll be showing some of my layout designs--still, yet, I might be showing films. Because my work varies so much in medium, I'll definitely need a modal to show details, offer descriptions, and proper context for the piece. Further, because of all the different disciplines I dabble in, some viewers might not be interested in all of them; I'll have to implement some sort of tagging/filtration system (e.g., films, fine art, graphic design, architectural design, etc.).
        </p>
        <p>
            The design I have laid out is one that will work with only one static page, then a modal. The homepage will be populated by tiles (screenshots, or previews, of each piece), and a click will bring up the modal. The viewer will be able to view piece details and descriptions in this menu. To filter artworks between categories, I'm thinking of adding tags to each piece, then having clickable tags on a nav. When a tag is clicked, all unrelated pieces will disappear from the homepage, leaving only the relevant tiles.
